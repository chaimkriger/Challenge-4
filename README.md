# Risk Return Analysis

For this application, i imported a CSV file with information on four different funds and the S&P 500, and prepared my daily returns DataFrame for analysis. Then, i did a quantitative analysis that includes the following: Performance, Volatility, Risk, Risk-return profile, and Portfolio diversification. First, i analyzed the data to determine if any if the portfolios outperform the stock market, by usin the plot function. Then, i used box plots to analyze the volatility of each of the four funds and the S&P 500. I then ananlyzed the risk profile of each portfolio by usin standard deviation and beta. Lastly, i determined the overall risk of the postfolios by using the Sharpe Ratios for each portfolio.
